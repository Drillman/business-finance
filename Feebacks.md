# Global

- I want the button to be more rounded by default
- Review the forms, some input label are on the side of the field instead of the top
- Make the sidebar foldable with only icons displayed. Expended make the sidebar a little slimer
- Make the modify/delete action button in the table icons

# Invoice page

- Rename this page "Factures"
- I don't have a lot of invoices during the year. I want the list to be like a timeline of the current year. Group the lines by month. Keep the kpi on top but for the year
- Refresh the list when something an invoice is added, modified or deleted
- List element action button should be icons (for a library) to save some space
- Add an action button when an invoice has a pending payment to add a payment date and change the status (popup dedicated to that)
- Invoices number suite is as follow yyyymmxx : yyyy -> current year / mm -> Invoice creation month / xx -> number of invoice of the year. For example : 20250102 -> second invoice of january 2025, 20251128 -> 28th invoice of the year 2025 in novembre. Take into account the latest invoice to prefill the invoice number in the new invoice popup.
- I want a dropdown of my clients. Manage the list in the settings page for now.
- I want a dropdown for the invoice description but be able to enter a new value. Manage the list in the settings page.

# Expenses page

- I get an error when deleting an expense
- When adding an expense, I want to fill the tax included price and select the tax percentage 20% by default. Add the other french tax percentages in the options.
- I want a subpage to handle fixed expenses like insurance that occurs monthly. I want a start month and end month (full year by default). I want the expense to be automatically added to the concerned months in another list on top of the other expenses.
- Remove the tags to see the amount by category
