# Global

- Make the modify/delete action button in the table icons
- Use less flashy colors for the KPIs
- Use popup for confirmation through out the app
- Use snackbar for action feedback instead of a warning type inside the page

# Invoice page

- Add an action button when an invoice has a pending payment to add a payment date and change the status (popup dedicated to that)
- Invoices number suite is as follow yyyymmxx : yyyy -> current year / mm -> Invoice creation month / xx -> number of invoice of the year. For example : 20250102 -> second invoice of january 2025, 20251128 -> 28th invoice of the year 2025 in novembre. Take into account the latest invoice to prefill the invoice number in the new invoice popup.
- Create an invoice configuration page accessible through the invoice page.
- I want a dropdown of my clients. Manage the list in the invoice settings page.
- I want a dropdown for the invoice description but be able to enter a new value. Manage the list in the invoice settings page.

# Expenses page

- I want a subpage to handle fixed expenses like insurance that occurs monthly. I want a start month and end month (full year by default). I want the expense to be automatically added to the concerned months in another list on top of the other expenses.
- On the by month view, I want a small list of the fixed expenses above the list of other expenses for the month with an edit button that goes to the fixed expenses tab
- Remove the tags to see the amount by category
